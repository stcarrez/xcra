Xcra is a tool which will help you record the time spent on various tasks, and manage a set of notes strongly or loosely coupled with the active task. If is very useful if you are faced with one of the following problems:

  * at the end of the day, you don't know where you have spent your time,
  * your project manager (or you) needs to charge the time on your project,
  * you have to remember complex commands (related or not to your project),
  * you have to remember some actions to do.

Xcra integrates a task manager and a note manager. The xcra task manager will help you on the following points:

  * it records each day the time spent on your different activities;
  * you inform xcra of the task that you are working on by clicking on a button;
  * you are able to add/subtract the time for a particular task and for a particular day;
  * you can create/remove tasks;
  * it produces several summary reports to understand where you have spent some time, on which activity, and how much.
  * it can save the information in an external database (specific database, Oleo data-sheet, ...).

The xcra note manager will help you on the following points:

  * it records various free-text which are correlated or not with a task. Such free-text could be:
    * a set of complex commands to launch (and to remember!);
    * a set of actions to do to finish the activity;
    * the result of a command that you want to save for some time;
    * personal notes...
  * it allows you to retrieve quickly some information related or not to the current activity;
