        This is XCra, a tool to record the time spent on various tasks,
   and manage a set of notes strongly (or loosely) coupled with
   the active task. `CRA' is the abreviation for Compte Rendu d'Activite'.

1. Requirements:

   You will need:

	o X11R5 or X11R6 (detected automatically, thanks imake)

	o gcc, g++ 4.2, (tested on sparc with g++ 2.7.2 and a long
	  time ago with g++ 2.4.5; or egcs 1.1.2)

	o GNU libiberty (if you want long name options)

	o perl

   Xcra has been tested on the following platforms:

	o SunOS 4.1.1, sun3, g++ 2.6.3/g++ 2.7.2, X11R6
	o SunOS 4.1.x, sun4, g++ 2.4.5/g++ 2.7.2, X11R5
	o SunOS 5.3, sun4, g++ 2.7.2, X11R5
	o SunOS 5.3, sun4, SUN C++ SparcWorks 4.0.1, X11R5
	o Sco ODT 3.0, i486, g++ 2.7.2, X11R5
	o Linux 1.2.13, i486, g++ 2.7.2, X11R6
	o Linux 2.2.14, i686, egcs 2.91.66, X11R6
        o Ubuntu 8.0.4, i686, gcc 4.2.4, X11R7

2. Compilation:

   You should do:
 
	./configure

	xmkmf

	make World

3. Installation:

   At top level:

	make install
	make install.man


4. Problems & Solutions:

   1) You don't have perl.

	- Perl is used by `help.perl' to generate the help file. The help
	file can be generated by hand using Emacs: you have to replace
	`next-help' by a \0. That is: Esc % next-help^Q^J <ret> ^Q^@ <ret>!

	- Perl is used by `cra-report' to produce summary reports.
	In that case, you can't use `cra-report' but `xcra' can still work.


   2) You don't have GNU libiberty.

	- libiberty is only used by `noteManager'. Only the getopt_long
	  feature is used. When the library is not available, long name
	  options are not present.

	- you can find libiberty with several GNU softwares (libg++ 2.7,
	  gdb 4.18). The reason why libiberty is not included in this
	  distribution is that you should use g++ and thus have libg++
	  installed.

   3) You have GNU libiberty but the GNU header file `getopt.h' can't be
      found.

	- get the `getopt.h' header (from libg++/gdb) and copy it at
	  top level of Xcra sources;

	- remove the configure cache file and reconfigure as follows:

	  CPPFLAGS=-I. configure

   4) You would like to test without installing xcra.

	Do the following:

	- cd progs
	- make install-test
	- setenv XAPPLRESDIR `pwd`
	- xcra &

   5) You have some compilation problems (wrong system headers, system
      headers not found, ...?).

	Edit the file `config.mk' (or `config.mk.in') to update
	the following:

	DependOptions		Additional options passed to makedepend
	SpecificOptions		"	"	" passed to C++ compiler
	CXX			Path of C++ compiler (updated by configure)
	CC			Path of C compiler
	OTHER_LIBRARIES		Additional libraries used in link edition.
