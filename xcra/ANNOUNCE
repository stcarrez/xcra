xcra is a tool which will help you recording the time spent on various
tasks, and manage a set of notes strongly or loosely coupled with
the active task. If is very useful if you are faced to one of the following
problems:

 - at the end of the day, you don't know where you have spent your time,

 - your project manager (or you) needs to charge the time on your project,

 - you have to remember complex commands (related or not to your project),

 - you have to remember some actions to do.


xcra integrates a task manager and a note manager. The xcra task manager
will help you on the following points:

  o it records each day the time spent on your different activities;

  o you inform xcra of the task that you are working on by clicking
    on a button;

  o you are able to add/subtract the time for a particular task and
    for a particular day;

  o you can create/remove tasks;

  o it produces several summary reports to understand where
    you have spent some time, on which activity, and how much.

  o it can save the information in an external database (specific
    database, Oleo data-sheet, ...).


The xcra note manager will help you on the following points:

  o it records various free-text which are correlated or not
    with a task. Such free-text could be:

	- a set of complex commands to launch (and to remember!);
	- a set of actions to do to finish the activity;
	- the result of a command that you want to save for
	  some time;
	- personal notes...

  o it allows you to retrieve quickly some information related or not to
    the current activity;


xcra contains an online help (English) for each dialog box it contains.
Online help is organized in topics and sub-topics for clarity and
easiness of use.
