List of things that could be done:

- Rewrite to use the GTK toolkit.

- View the graph of notes and get a popup menu to:

	-> edit the note,
	-> create new note,
	-> delete the note,
	-> rename it,
	-> pack/unpack the graphical representation
	   of the sub-tree (if the sub-tree is visible
	   show it and vice versa).

  The graph must get all the notes file for all the
  tasks.

- Be able to edit external files

- Introduce a X11 selection mechanism based on the notes
  to be able to select a note from the tool `noteManager'.
  The idea is to be able to define accelerator keys in the
  window manager which would launch `noteManager' to save
  the current X11 selection in a note. (This could act
  as a `save current X11 selection' operation).

- Move the search in the notes out of the xcra process

- Automatic update of all the dialog boxes when something
  is changed. If a task is created, the new task must appear
  in all other dialog boxes. If it is deleted, it must be
  removed. A preliminary support is here with the
  virtual method XawDialog::update() and the static
  method XawDialog::updateAll().

- Generate and keep up-to-date, a task notes glue file
  which points out to all the different notes file of the
  different tasks. Such glue file can serve for scanning
  in all the notes.

- Use the query to the external database to check that
  the task is valid

- Introduce IDL so that foreign tools could be able to
  query (current task, list of tasks,...) and change
  the active task (or any other feature that distribution
  brings...).

- Use GNU NLS to support several languages (french).

- Integrate an alarm manager in the notes/tasks to be
  able to provide a TODO note bound to a task. The TODO
  note lists some actions which must be done before a
  specified date. A warning popup dialog is opened
  when the date has expired and the action is not performed.

- Defines two specific notes for each task: a TODO note
  and a DONE note. When an action is completed, the TODO
  note can transfer the action description in the DONE note.
  The cra-report tool must be able to scan the TODO/DONE
  notes to build the week summary report.

- Introduce IDL to let a project manager update the TODO
  notes of the members of the team.
